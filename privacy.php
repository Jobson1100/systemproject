			<h3>Your privacy is very important to us at camping.com. We have established and implemented information
				<br>
				handling practices for www.camping.com that we believe represent the highest standards and best
				practices <br>
				of organizations doing business on the Internet. This privacy policy ("Policy") describes the practices
				<br>
				that apply to our site, including, specifically, the information we collect about you,<br>
				when and how we collect that information and what may happen to that information. <br>

		<br>
			We may also combine anonymous information supplied by you and other users during registration on our
				<br>
				site with information about your use and others' use of our site. We will use this combined information
				<br>
				to describe our user base, without reference to any specific individual, to potential partners,
				investors <br>
				and advertisers. We will not share your Personal Information with any other users of our site, but we
				<br>
				may use information we collect about your travel preferences and experiences to make recommendations to
				<br>
				other users of our site. We may also share aggregated statistical information about users of our site
				<br>

				session. <br>
				This is why you must enter a unique User Name and Password each time you access your account information
				<br>

				You can take steps to maximize your security online and protect your confidential information. Never
				share your <br>
